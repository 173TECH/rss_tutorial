# This tutorial is composed of one DAG
# Please see the DAG section of the documentation for more details:
# https://173tech.github.io/sayn/dags/

# DAGs define at minimum a set of tasks
# Those will be run for this DAG when SAYN runs
# To run the tutorial, run the command 'sayn run' from the project folder's root
tasks:
  # python
  # here we define a Python task
  # python tasks are stored into the python folder
  # this task loads some data into our SQLite database
  load_data:
    type: python
    class: load_data.LoadData

  # autosql
  # autosql tasks enable to write a SELECT statement and SAYN creates the table / view automatically
  # the SQL queries for those models are stored into the sql folder
  full_cleaned_data:
    preset: modelling
    file_name: clean_and_agg.sql
    parents:
      - load_data

  nlp:
    type: python
